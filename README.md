# W7-kaggle-project

## Objective

The objective of this project is to create a machine learning model that predicts the price of diamonds from a database of diamond characteristics. The model predictions will be submited to kaggle in order to obtain a final score and a position in the ranking.


## Documents

Two jupyters:
 - Cleaning.ipynb: Clean the Dataset.
 - Modeling.ipnyb: Create the model, optimize and make the predictions.

A data folder containing: 
 - The initial dataset. 
 - The clean datasets. 
 - The result of the model predictions. 

And this README.md file with a brief summary.
